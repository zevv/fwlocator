fwlocator
=========

This project consists of two parts:

* An Android app which detects fireworks noise and sends events to a central
  site. 

* An application running on a central site receives events from three or more
  devices, and calculates the origin of the noise using triangulation. Detected
  locations are made visible using the Openstreetmap or Google maps API.
